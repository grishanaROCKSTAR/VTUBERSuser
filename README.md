# Welcome to README.md! This script was created by grishanya (EXPEREMENTAL BRANCH)

Script is open-source and free. You can use it via Python3 in a console. This branch has not a compilated .exe file

How to use:

1. Via .exe file: start a compilated .exe file and use it.
2. Via .py file in a console:
